# SortingHat.py : simulates a Harry Potter style sorting hat, but with good distribution across the 4 houses
# Intention: Used as a way to divvy a lot of people up into 4 teams with a good distribution across teams.
#    Note: the good distribution assertion here is based on the usage of many people using the device in
#          single powered on session. Everytime the device is reset, state is lost, breaking the distribution.
#          The original intent was to set the sample size to 3 x the number of houses (4) which will give 
#          repetition in the selections and make it appear like a distribution isn't being forced.

# this should be more parameterized and dynamic; currently hardcoded
# there are 4 houses to be selected into. We want selection to be randomized but we 
# also want a fairly even distribution along with the appearance of randomization.
# So the approach is to create a base list, with the 4 houses listed 3 times. 
# this will give us a normalized distribution across 12 selections which should be
# a good mix of seeming randomness across a lot of presses. If there are fewer 
# people expected to press the button at once (I'm expecting about 120 per session)
# you could reduce the series to 2x or 1x the number of houses.
